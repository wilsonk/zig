/// Any 64-bit register can be turned into its 32-bit form by adding 16, and
/// vice versa. This also works between 32-bit and 16-bit forms. With 8-bit, it
/// works for all except for sp, bp, si, and di, which don't *have* an 8-bit
/// form.
///
/// If (register & 8) is set, the register is extended.
///
/// The ID can be easily determined by figuring out what range the register is
/// in, and then subtracting the base.
